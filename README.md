# Home_Sales
Bootcamp Module 22 Challenge

## Requirements
This project was created using Google Colab.

## Overview

The files contained in the Home_Sales repository were created as an educational bootcamp project to use SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Spark was used to create temporary views, partition data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify the table has been uncached.

SQL Queries were run using SparkSQL to answer the following questions:

    1. What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

    2. What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

    3. What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

    4. What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.
